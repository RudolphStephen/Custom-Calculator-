üßÆ Custom Calculator (JavaFX)
A flexible, JavaFX-based calculator designed to enforce arithmetic constraints based on selected academic grade levels (Grade 4, 5, and 6).
üåü Features
This calculator is unique because its division and subtraction rules change dynamically based on the selected grade level.

Standard Arithmetic: Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (x), and Division (/).

Grade Level Toggle: Uses Radio Buttons to switch between Grade 4, Grade 5, and Grade 6 modes.

Grade 4 Mode Rules:

Subtraction: Does not allow negative results (if num2 > num1, it returns an error).

Division: Only allows division that results in a whole number (no remainder); otherwise, it returns an error.

Grade 5 Mode Rules:

Division: Displays the quotient with the remainder appended (e.g., 5R2).

Grade 6 Mode Rules:

Division: Displays the full decimal result, formatted to four decimal places (e.g., 0.2500).

Clear Functionality: Resets both input and result fields.

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
Language: Java

Framework: JavaFX (for UI components: GridPane, VBox, Button, TextField, RadioButton).

Logic: Uses a switch statement to apply grade-specific logic after the user presses the = button.
